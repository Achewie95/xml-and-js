While creating this (what I thought would be an hour assignment but ended up being 2 days), I spent most of the time troubleshooting my xsl file as it could not display the results and only displayed a blank white screen. While initially thinking it was due to my links not being correct and some favicon issue (lol), I came to realize it was my validators not working. After slowly troubleshooting blocks of code, I finally solved the issue and screenshot attached of the result.


In terms of the xsl code, I followed the activity-4 example in creating tables and researching online on how to create a table inside a table. I also struggled with the 'gender' validation as I thought it could be an if-else statement, but a friend pointed out that a case statement would be easier and it got my code working. 

For the naming conventions and rules, it wasn't too hard to duplicate after completing activity-4.

1. For the DTD file, I first had to identity the Element tags. As you can see at the bottom of the file (commented), there is the tree of elements and its nested child. Once identified, I am able to write out the DTD. The writing convention takes a little used to and I had to refer to previous examples on achieving the right notation. Attached is a screenshot after verifying the file with no errors.

2. For the XSD file, this went a lot smoother and quicker as I had already identify the Element tags, and have a reference from the DTD file that I did. Writing it all out was just a matter of getting the conventions right and the format. Writing the XSD file is a lot quicker too as the tags are more straightforward and logical.

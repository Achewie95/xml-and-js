For this project, I made the xsd and the xsl file. Ricardo made the initial xml and the dtd, and angelique did the html part. 

We worked really well together and had no issues dividing the workload - which we were all satisfied in splitting equally. We also helped each other out whenever someone was stuck and we were all responsive during the project. 

Our wavelength was good as well as we managed to complete the project early - allowing us to enjoy the rest of the reading week and of course study for the JS quiz :)
